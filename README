------------------------------------------------------------

Changelog
---------

- December 2012 (sf2)

(*) WoS: added support for v3 of the API
(*) WoS: added support for Lite or Premium account
(*) WoS: added restrictions for the maximum number of requests per seconds (2) 
and per session (10,000)
(*) WoS: Unicode patch for queries
(*) Scopus: support for updated API / End-points
(*) bin script: if 'filename' is omitted, the script will process all the items
in the live archive


These scripts and plug-ins enable an EPrints repository to retrieve and store
citation counts from Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar.

Your institution requires a subscription to Scopus and Web of Science in order
to use the plug-ins for their services. Google Scholar is freely accessible,
but requests that robots do not extract data from its web site (so you should
only use the plug-in to conduct searches triggered manually). See the web sites
listed below for the details for each service.

Scopus:
  The Scopus plug-in uses the Scopus XML Search API. In addition to a
  subscription to Scopus, your institution requires a developer key for the
  API. See http://searchapi.scopus.com.

Web of Science:
  The Web of Science plug-in uses Web of Science Web Services Lite. In addition
  to possessing a subscription to Web of Science, your institution must sign up
  for access to the web services at
  http://isiwebofknowledge.com/products_tools/products/related/webservices.

Google Scholar:
  The Google Scholar plug-in is a screen-scraper based on the Export::GScholar
  plug-in shipped with EPrints 3. See
  http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/about,html. Google's full terms of
  use are at http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS.


Installation
------------

Before using the import plug-ins, you need to install SOAP::Lite (for Web of
Science) and WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy (for Google Scholar) from CPAN.

1. Copy all of the files in the 'eprints' sub-directory into the root directory
   of your EPrints installation, e.g. 'cp -R eprints/* /opt/eprints3'

2. Copy all of the files in the 'archives' sub-directory into the configuration
   folder of the archive into which you want to import citation data, e.g.
   'cp -R archives/* /opt/eprints3/archives/foobar'

3. Go to the cfg.d directory of your archive.
   (a) Move the contents of eprint_fields.pl.inc into your eprints_fields.pl
   (b) Move the contents of datasets.pl.inc into your datasets.pl
   (c) Insert your Scopus developer key into scapi.pl
   (d) Check the options in scapi.pl, wos.pl and gscholar.pl
   (e) If you want to view and manipulate citation objects via the "Manage
       Records" interface, add the lines "+citation/view" and
       "+citation/destroy" the appropriate user roles in user_roles.pl

4. Update the database structure of your archive to include the new dataset
   and fields, e.g. 'epadmin update_database_structure foobar'

You may also want to look through the import plug-ins themselves and ensure
that their use of eprint types and fields is suitable for your archive.


Using the Plug-ins
------------------

You can import citation data into your database using the import_citationdata
and update_citationdata scripts.

import_citationdata requests data for a given list of eprint IDs.

update_citationdata is intended to be run as a daily or hourly cron job, and
implements a schedule that requests data for every eprint once per month.

See the Perl documentation for each script for details on how to invoke the
scripts, i.e. use 'perldoc /opt/eprints3/bin/import_citationdata'.

All citation data is stored in a dataset called 'citation'. The most recent
counts for any given eprint are cached in the 'scopus', 'wos' and 'gscholar'
fields of that eprint. E.g. to display Scopus' citation count on an eprint's
summary page, put <epc:print expr="scopus_impact"/> in the appropriate place
of your summary_page.xml.
